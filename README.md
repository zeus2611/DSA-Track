## Hi, I'm [Nischay](https://nischay.github.io),
And in this Repository I'll be uploadig all the resources that i find will be helpful in accelerating your progress toward your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

Note:- This repo will be in C++. As it's easy and fast for Competative Programming.

So, structure of track is as follows:
* Basics of any programming language
    - Input/Outpu
    - Operators
    - Data Types
    - Binary Number System
    - Conditional Statements
    - Loops
    - Functions
    - Time Complexity

* Basic Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - 2-D Arrays
    - Character Arrays
    - Strings
    - Vectors & Pairs

* Basic Algorithms
    - Basic Sorting
    - Pointers
    - Stack and Heaps
    - Bit Manipulation
    - Sieve of Eratosthenes
    - Inclusion Exclusion Principle
    - Basic Recursion

* Object Oriented Programming ( OOPs )
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

I'll will keep upadting the repo with new content frequently.
