## Hi, We're Project Hades, ##

And in this Repository We'll be uploadig all the resources that we find will be helpful in accelerating your progress toward your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

Note:- This repo will be in C++. As it's easy and fast for Competative Programming. 


So, structure of track is as follows:
* Basics of any programming language
    - [Input/Outpu](https://github.com/zeus2611/DSA-Track/tree/main/1.%20Basics%20of%20Programming/1.1.%20Input-Output)
    - [Operators](https://github.com/zeus2611/DSA-Track/tree/main/1.%20Basics%20of%20Programming/1.2.%20Operators)
    - [Data Types]()
    - [Binary Number System]()
    - [Conditional Statements]()
    - [Loops]()
    - [Functions]()
    - [Time Complexity]()

* Basic Data Structures
    - [Arrays]()
    - [2-D Arrays]()
    - [Character Arrays]()
    - [Strings]()
    - [Vectors & Pairs]()

* Basic Algorithms
    - [Basic Sorting]()
    - [Pointers]()
    - [Stack and Heaps]()
    - [Bit Manipulation]()
    - [Sieve of Eratosthenes]()
    - [Inclusion Exclusion Principle]()
    - [Basic Recursion]()

* Object Oriented Programming ( OOPs )
    - [Encapsulation]()
    - [Inheritance]()
    - [Polymorphism]()

We'll will keep upadting the repo with new content frequently.
